Documentation with a collection of recommended practices by the Front-End team of Valtech CH, which can be easily shared and apply to any project.

It should be a shared documentation in the Valtech CH Front-End team where we bring the learnings from our projects, we ask for feedback and we agree on good practices to follow.
