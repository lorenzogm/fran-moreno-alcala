# Deployments

Deployments are handled by GitHub Actions. Currently (2022.04) the deployment to production is configured at [deploy.yml](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

Requirements:

1. Create a project in Vercel (through the UI or the CLI)
2. Define Vercel secrets in GitHub

## Create a project in Vercel with the CLI

[Docs for the CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)

Run Vercel:

    npx vercel

Follow the default instructions or what makes sense for your case. Keep an eye on those two settings, because Ring is a monorepo:

Define where the next app is located in the apps folder:

    In which directory is your code located? ./apps/next-storyblok-tailwind

Define the custom build script for turborepo:

    cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --scope=next-storyblok-tailwind --include-dependencies --no-deps

Finally, a `./vercel` folder is created.

## Define Vercel secrets in GitHub

The Vercel secrets need to be added to the secrects in your GitHub repository. Those are the required secrets:

- VERCEL_TOKEN
- VERCEL_ORG_ID
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

The `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and the `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` can be found in the `./vercel/project.json` file created in the previous step.

The `VERCEL_TOKEN` needs to be created in the [Vercel UI](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).
